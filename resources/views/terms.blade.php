        <p>Standard Return Policy:</p>
        <p>While our customers have seen spectacular results — if for any reason you try our product/s and are not
            satisfied, or just want to exchange it for another quality product, you are fully guaranteed by our 90-day
            return/exchange period. </p>
        <p>Just follow our simple process here to get started: </p>
        <p>Contact our friendly customer concierge team at 1-800-000-0000 or send an email to <a
                href="mailto:support@adken.com">support@adken.com</a> </p>
        <p>Please tell our concierge agent whether you’d like a Return or an Exchange and she will provide you with an
            RMA No. (Return Merchandise Authorization) or an EMA No. (Exchange Merchandise Authorization) and our Return
            Address.</p>
        <p>Please include both the unused and empty containers in the return package. Write the RMA No. or EMA No. on
            the outside of the shipping package, and send the product/s back to the Return Address provided (within 90
            days from your date of purchase). Refunds are proportional to the amount of product returned, so if 3
            bottles out of 6 bottle order are returned, customer will receive a 50% refund less s+h. For exchanges,
            please indicate what product/s you want to try (of equal or lesser value than your return product). Write
            the product name/s on a piece of paper and mail it with your return package.</p>
        <p>Note on Exchanges: Your order is eligible for our 90-day Preferred Exchange Program. Under this program, you
            can return any product you’ve purchased in exchange for another quality Adken product (of equal or
            lesser value) – with free shipping when we send your exchange package. All exchanges are final.</p>
        <p>Send the package via your preferred shipping courier (USPS is cost-effective and fast). Return shipping costs
            are the responsibility of the customer. You may opt to provide us the tracking/confirmation number for easy
            monitoring and a faster return credit. Please allow 5-10 business days for your return to be processed and
            reflected on your bank/credit account</p>
        <p>Important: Used or empty bottles are only eligible for returns if sufficient time has passed to consume the
            product as directed. For example, we will not accept 3 empty bottles (3-month supply) or 5 empty bottles
            (5-month supply) after only one or two months. We offer a fair return policy to you and in return, we ask
            that you be fair with us as well.</p>
        <p>IMPORTANT NOTES/REMINDERS:</p>
        <p>Guarantee Period: In order for us to issue your full refund or exchange, the product/s must arrive our
            facilities within 90 days of the original purchase date. (Ex. If your original purchase date is July 16,
            2018 you should have returned products on or before January 18, 2019)</p>
        <p>Refund Amount: Refunds are proportional to the amount of product returned. For example, if only 3 bottles out
            of a 6 bottle order are returned, customer will receive a 50% refund less S+H</p>
        <p>For Return Postage: customers are responsible for postage costs, except for company shipment errors</p>
        <p>For Exchange Postage: under our Preferred Exchange Policy, customers are only responsible for the return
            postage cost. You will receive free shipping when we send back the exchanged items.</p>
        <p>RMA/EMA: You must have an RMA or EMA number on your package before returning a product to us. Contact our
            concierge team by phone or email to receive this number.</p>
        <p>Refused/Undeliverable: All packages returned to us as “refused” or “undeliverable” shall be refunded in full
            less original S+H fees and less any fees levied upon us by postal providers during return shipping.</p>
        <p>Any product returns that do not comply with our stated return policies are subject to loss of refund, or a
            partial refund.</p>
